1. How do I approach designing software?
My work on this project allowed me to further develop my C++ skills and 
taught me how to think about objects in a 3D way. For a design process,
I first learned how to create triangles. Everything after that was a matter
of figuring out how to create a new shape using triangles. Tactics from my 
design approach could be used in future work by utilizing simple tasks to 
accomplish a more complicated task.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
New development strategies that I worked on while creating my 3D scene were
creating objects, using multiple simple objects to create complex objects, and
applying textures and lighting to a scene. Iteration factored into my development
because I was forced to repeat steps from earlier weeks to create the complex
final scene. My approach developing the code evolved by constantly checking
my work and debugging the program to make sure each new addition to the 
code did not create a fatal error when attempting to run it. This allowed me
to catch bugs and errors as they happened rather than dealing with them at the
very end.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
While computational graphics and visualizations don't directly relate to my job
goals, it still allowed me to improve my ability to read and write code. It also
taught me how to think about objects in a 3-dimensional way, and will help me 
when considering how to display data in an understandable way.
